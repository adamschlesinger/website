        <p>I am a game systems director with 15 years of professional experience in software engineering across the
          stack for mobile platforms. I have managed many projects from start to finish within start-up environments as
          well as large organizations on user scales ranging from a few thousand MAU to millions of DAU.</p>

        <p>Over my time in the industry I have launched over 20 games and actively participated in the development and
          maintenance of 30+. Nearly half of these titles have also been run in live operation.</p>

        <p>Beyond professional knowledge I regularly keep sharp reading up on the latest tech with a bevy of side
          projects as well. I keep balanced with healthy background and interest in art and design.</p>
