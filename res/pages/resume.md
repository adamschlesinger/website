i have a personal mission statement i've put together over my time in game development which is **provide the tools
people need to succeed**. "tools" can be any of literal software tools, career guidance, knowledge, process, etc. it is
my greatest joy to ensure everyone i work with is armed with everything they need to accomplish their goals.

# experience

a preface: i do not believe that result numbers belong in resumes. if you disagree then please do not consider me for
your opportunity. capitalism high scores are not an indicator of good work. showing understanding of the "why" and "how"
of prior projects proves ability to take action. it's fine to fail as long as you know how you got there.

# knowledge

quickly i can hit the ground running. regardless of each items' position i typically spin up on anything new very fast.
