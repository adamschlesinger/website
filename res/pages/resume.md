todo - mission statement

# experience
a preface: i do not believe that result numbers belong in resumes. if you disagree then please do not consider me for
your opportunity. capitalism high scores are not an indicator of good work. showing understanding of the "why"and "how"
of prior projects proves ability to take action. it's fine to fail as long as you know how you got there.

# knowledge
i'm a generalist, and i touch **a ton** of tech with great frequency, but these are **roughly** ordered by level of how
quickly i can hit the ground running. regardless of each items' position i typically spin up on anything new very fast.

# education
