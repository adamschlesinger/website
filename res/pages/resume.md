i am a game systems director with 15 years of professional experience in software engineering across the stack for
primarily mobile platforms. i have professionally launched over 20 games and worked on over 30 with more than half of
those being run live. i've worked on games with user bases from as low as a few hundred mau to as high as several
millions of dau.

i have a personal mission statement i've put together over my time in game development which is **provide the tools
people need to succeed**. "tools" can be any of literal software tools, career guidance, knowledge, process, etc. it is
my greatest joy to ensure everyone i work with is armed with everything they need to accomplish their goals.

beyond professional life i've been making games on mobile since the palm pilot days. more recently i spend time
contributing to open source, honing coding experience with side projects, playing my guitar, 3d printing, trying to
convince myself to get on the rower more often, and of course playing video games.

# experience

a preface: i do not believe that result numbers belong in resumes. if you disagree then please do not consider me for
your opportunity. capitalism high scores are not an indicator of good work. showing understanding of the "why" and "how"
of prior projects proves ability to take action. it's fine to fail as long as you know how you got there.

## director of technology, mobile

### [2k]

- designed and organized cross-org development of a game engine-agnostic, universal analytics and crm stack built for
  zero integration time and behavioral consistency.
- regularly evaluated, onboarded, and worked with contractor teams to accelerate development for high priority
  requirements.
- made discovery a primary pillar to ensure that product, marketing, and game development teams were fully aware of the
  range of capabilities made available to them.
- wrote mountains of specs, documentation, diagrams, and decks to ensure alignment on development goals.

## staff software engineer

### [onesignal]

- worked with peers to architect and build out major underlying system refactors in order to streamline future
  development efforts and eliminate redundant work.
- built and released a showcase game in unity to serve as a source for handling quality assurance, dogfooding, and to
  provide a sample best-practices application to clients.
- setup cicd pipelines for various sdks with junior engineers as mentoring exercises.
- established and ran a developer “book” club with projects designed to build developer empathy and a greater knowledge
  base of similar products.

## engineering manager

### [tilting point]

- coordinated international development efforts across internal departments and external game development partners to
  determine engineering priorities for all parties.
- managed two independent teams: asset automation and cms for game and ad content and the other a partner-facing stack
  of unity sdk and accompanying backend microservices covering ad mediation, attribution, analytics, and live
  operations.
- served as architect for all engineering efforts by helping team members to scope work, determine ideal api design,
  documentation, design patterns, unit test coverage, and operating “shoulder studies” for pipeline tooling.
- continued building code and working to use the tools i was creating as mentoring opportunities for my junior
  engineers.

## lead fullstack engineer

### [tilting point]

- led the design and implementation of a major refactor to the entire internal analytics pipeline from sdk to data
  warehousing. ensured the new systems would “stick” by actively coordinating with the data analysis team to ensure a
  smooth hand-off.
- built several full-stack microservices for fully managing in-app purchases across titles and major distribution
  platforms.

## mobile engineer

### [tilting point]

- took over as primary engineer of an in-house sdk written for unity games. the sdk was
  purpose-built to make the experience of operating a vast portfolio of live games more
  consistent across titles as well as easing implementation of key live operation features.
- handled developer outreach, relationships, and support for new and existing partners.

## programmer

### [freshplanet]

- created and maintained open-source code libraries using as3, obj-c, and java for a
  portfolio of mobile games covering analytics, ad mediation, async helpers, and others.
- built out a toolset to automate the scraping of published ad information and automatic
  reporting of non-functional and/or unapproved content.
- responsible for optimizing all native c++ code for cross-platform plugins.
- designed and implemented a new cooperative gameplay system.

## programmer

### [dreamkind]

- worked with artists to design and fully build in-house games from scratch with both flash
  (as3) and cocos2d-x.
- used several well-known brands in early childhood education to develop games. actively
  participated in design sessions with the license holders.
- co-architected a python server on google cloud for sharing content from user to user.
- defined workflow and client project architecture among a small team of artists and devs.

# knowledge

i'm a generalist. i touch **a ton** of tech with extreme frequency, but these will eventually be **roughly** ordered by
level of how quickly i can hit the ground running. regardless of each items' position i typically spin up on anything
new very fast.

# education

is this even relevant anymore? i'm old and more concerned about ageism than this.
