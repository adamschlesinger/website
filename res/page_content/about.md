I am a game systems director with 15 years of professional experience in software engineering across the stack for 
mobile platforms. I have managed many projects from start to finish within start-up environments as well as large 
organizations on user scales ranging from a few thousand MAU to millions of DAU.

Over my time in the industry I have launched over 20 games and actively participated in the development and 
maintenance of 30+. Nearly half of these titles have also been run in live operation.

Beyond professional knowledge I regularly keep sharp reading up on the latest tech with a bevy of side projects as 
well. I keep balanced with healthy background and interest in art and design.

### why "bad planning"?
it's part of a quote that's resonated with me for years: "adventure is just bad planning". to be clear i have no idea 
what roald amundsen's intention here was but i love this quote from both a positive and negative look at adventure.
