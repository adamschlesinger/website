  about: |
    there has been a constant issue with every game project i've worked on: git is phenomenal for programmers but sucks
    for artists.
    
    locker is a project designed to replicate a lot of what actually does work for artists from other version control
    solutions. locker use the locking feature of git lfs to create workspaces that artists can pull binary files
    into.
