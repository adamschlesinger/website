<div id="resume">
<p>i am a game systems director with 15 years of professional experience in software engineering across the stack for
primarily mobile platforms. i have professionally launched over 20 games and worked on over 30 with more than half of
those being run live. i've worked on games with user bases from as low as a few hundred mau to as high as several
millions of dau.</p>
<p>i have a personal mission statement i've put together over my time in game development which is <strong>provide the tools
people need to succeed</strong>. "tools" can be any of literal software tools, career guidance, knowledge, process, etc. it is
my greatest joy to ensure everyone i work with is armed with everything they need to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>beyond professional life i've been making games on mobile since the palm pilot days. more recently i spend time
contributing to open source, honing coding experience with side projects, playing my guitar, 3d printing, trying to
convince myself to get on the rower more often, and of course playing video games.</p>

<p>a preface: i do not believe that result numbers belong in resumes. if you disagree then please do not consider me for
your opportunity. capitalism high scores are not an indicator of good work. showing understanding of the "why" and "how"
of prior projects proves ability to take action. it's fine to fail as long as you know how you got there.</p>

<p>i'm a generalist. i touch <strong>a ton</strong> of tech with extreme frequency, but these will eventually be <strong>roughly</strong> ordered by
level of how quickly i can hit the ground running. regardless of each items' position i typically spin up on anything
new very fast.</p>
